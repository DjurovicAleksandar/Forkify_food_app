## Overview

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the food2fork API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7, and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and add ingredients to a shopping list or save it to a favorites list via local storage.
